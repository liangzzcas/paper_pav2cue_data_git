the fibers in 3a (are the same as fig. 2f (left) and fig.2h) which are G12_ROI39 (example in left in fig 3a) and G21ROI27 (example in right in fig 3a), and yes Fig 3a traces and heatmap are aligned to reward delivery.
For Fig 5a is  G23 ROI 19, and fig 5c is G23 ROI36.
For Sup Fig 2e:  The blue trace (aVS) is G12ROI51, Red trace (aDS) is G12ROI2 and the green trace (medial VS) is G12ROI19
